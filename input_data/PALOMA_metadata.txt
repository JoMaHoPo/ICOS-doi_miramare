PALOMA FIXED STATION, METADATA

PIs: Anna Luchetta, Carolina Cantoni
Responsible institution: Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Istituto di scienze marine (CNR-ISMAR), Trieste, Italy 
Location of fixed station: 45.6204N 13.5658E in the Gulf of Trieste 
Selected sensors at PALOMA: Contros HydroC CO2 at 3 m depth; Sea-Bird SBE37-ODO at 3 m depth
Sensor deployed from the research vessel while at the fixed station: Sea-Bird SBE37 at 0.5 m depth
Discrete samples for inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen are collected from the station.

The dataset described here is collected during the ATL2MED demonstration experiment (see below) and consists of sensor data, 
discrete data, auxillary data, and metadata.

The sensor data was collected during 2020-07-15
The discrete carbon data was collected at 2020-07-15.

The CO2 sensor measured continously for 20 min intervals, and the pCO2 data represents an averaged value over these 20 min. The time 
is the average time.

Discrete samples were collected and analysed for pH and Total Alkalinity (TA) and dissolved oxygen (Winkler method). Discrete pCO2 was calculated 
using CO2SYS (Pelletier et al., 2007), with the carbonate system constants from Lueker et al. (2000), the HSO4- constant from Dickson (1990), the 
total borate-salinity relationship of Lee et al. (2010), and the KF constant from Perez and Fraga (1987). pH on total scale and PO4=0 and Si=2 umol/kg.
The sensor pCO2 data (pCO2_corr) is corrected by adjusting these data to the calculated discrete pCO2 and sensor DO data was corrected to the discrete DO measurements.

Dissolved oxygen (DO) data measured by the sensor is corrected (DO_corr) using discrete oxygen samples analysed by winkler titration.

The ATL2MED demonstration experiment took place in the North-East Atlantic between October 2019 and July 2020.
During this time, two Salidrone vessels equipped with scientific instruments sailed from the North-East Atlantic Ocean 
to the Gulf of Trieste in the Mediterranean Sea. A number of fixed stations also took part in the experiment, 
e.g., DYFAMED, W1M3A, E2M3A, PALOMA, and MIRAMARE, which all were visited by the Saildorne vessels.
