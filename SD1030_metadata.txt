SD1030 is an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) provided by the US company Saildrone. The SD1030 took part in the ATL2MED demonstration experiment 
from October 2019 to July 2020. During this time, the SD1030 equipped with scientific instruments sailed from the North-East Atlantic Ocean 
to the Gulf of Trieste in the Mediterranean Sea. A number of fixed ocean stations also took part in the experiment, 
e.g., DYFAMED, W1M3A, E2M3A, PALOMA, and MIRAMARE, which all were visited by the SD1030 vehicle. A second ASV, SD1053, also took part in the 
demonstration experiment.

The dataset described here is collected by the SD1030 during the ATL2MED demonstration experiment and consists of sensor data in a separate file 
(SD1030_T_S_DO_CO2_final) and metadata (SD1030, described here).

The datafile contains the following columns:
Platform:
Date-Time: DD.MM.YYY hh:mm:ss
Longitude: longitude E
Latitude: latitude N
Depth_m: depth of the SBE37ODO sensor
T_SBE_degC: temperature measured by SBE37-SMP-ODO (degree C)
S_SBE_corr: salinity measured by SBE37-SMP-ODO and corrected for drift
DO_SBE_uncorr_umol/L: dissolved oxygen measured by SBE37-SMP-ODO, uncorrected
RelHum_%: relative humidity (%)
Press_atm_hPa: atmospheric pressure (hPa)
T_air_degC: air temperature (degree C)
DOsat_uncorr_%: dissolved oxygen saturation (%), uncorrected
DOsat_corr_%:  dissolved oxygen saturation (%), corrected
pO2_mbar: oxygen partial pressure (mbar), matlab function named O2ctoO2p
VP: vapour pressure calculated from T_air according to equation in Aanderaa Optode (model 4330) manual
pO2_sat_mbar: oxygen partial pressure saturation calculated from T_atm, Press_atm, and RelHum
Gain: correction factor, calculated from pO2_sat_mbar/pO2_mbar
DO_SBE_corr_umol/L: dissolved oxygen measured by SBE37-SMP-ODO, corrected for drift and offset
Press_atm_LiCor_hPA: atmospheric pressure measured at atmospheric intake for CO2 measurements 1 m asl, used for pCO2 calculations
xCO2_sea_dry_umol/mol: mol fraction CO2 in sea water, dry value (umol/mol) 
xCO2_air_dry_umol/mol: mol fraction CO2 in air, dry value (umol/mol)
pCO2_sea_wet_uatm: partial pressure of CO2 in sea water, at 100% humidity (uatm)
NaN: no data

Correction of dissolved oxygen is following that of Bittig et al. (2016; 2017) and Johnson et al. (2015).
Correction of CO2 is performed by PMEL (USA) as described in Martellucci et al. (in prep), and the pCO2 accuracy is < 5 uatm. 

Note that between 27 May 2020 and 6 June 2020, the SD1030 was at key in Sicily.
