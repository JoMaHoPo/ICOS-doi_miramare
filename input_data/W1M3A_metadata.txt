W1M3A FIXED STATION, METADATA

PI: Roberto Bozzano and Sara Pensieri
Responsible institution: Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Istituto per lo studio degli impatti Antropici e Sostenibilit√† in 
ambiente marino (IAS), Genoa, Italy.  
Location of fixed station: 43.8345N 9.11823E in the Ligurian Sea, Mediterranean Sea.
Selected sensors at W1M3A: Pro-Oceanus CO2-Pro CV at 8 m depth; Sea-Bird SBE56 at 8 m depth.

The dataset described here is collected during the ATL2MED demonstration experiment (see below) and consists of sensor data and metadata.

The sensor data was collected between 2020-04-29 and 2020-05-02

The CO2 sensor measured every two hour.

Columns in the W1M3A_sensor file:
Fixed_Station: W1M3A
Year: year of data logging
Month_UTC: month of data logging
Day_UTC: day of data logging
Hour_UTC: hour of data logging, UTC time
Minute_UTC: second of data logging, UTC time
Latitude: degree E
Longitude: degree N
Depth_dbar: depth of sensors (dbar) 
T_SBE_degC: temperature logged by SBE56 (degC)
pCO2_raw_uatm: pCO2 in water logged by Pro-Oceanus sensor, raw data (uatm)
S_MEDSEA: salinity determined from the MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004 model
Pres_atm_hPa: Atmospheric pressure determined from ECMWF (hPa)
T_atm_degC: Temperature in air determined from ECMWF (degC)
Wind_Speed_m/s: Wind speed determined from ECMWF (m/s)
DO_MEDSEA_umol/m3: Dissolved oxygen determined from MEDSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_BGC_006_014 model(umol/m3)
pH_MEDSEA: pH determined from the MEDSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_BGC_006_014 model
TA_MEDSEA_mol/m3: Total Alkalinity determined from the MEDSEA_ANALYSISFORECAST_BGC_006_014 model (mol/m3)

Due to the Covid pandemic restrictions, no discrete samples were collected, and thus,the pCO2 sensor data is the raw data.

The ATL2MED demonstration experiment took place in the North-East Atlantic between October 2019 and July 2020.
During this time, two Salidrone vessels equipped with scientific instruments sailed from the North-East Atlantic Ocean 
to the Gulf of Trieste in the Mediterranean Sea. A number of fixed stations also took part in the experiment, 
e.g., DYFAMED, W1M3A, E2M3A, PALOMA, and MIRAMARE, which all were visited by the Saildorne vessels.
