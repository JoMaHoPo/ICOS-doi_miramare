MIRAMARE FIXED STATION, METADATA

PI: Michele Giani (mgiani@ogs.it) 
Responsible institution: Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS), Trieste, Italy 
Location of fixed station: 45.689N 13.708E in the Gulf of Trieste 
Selected sensors at MIRAMARE: CO2 (Pro-Oceanus CO2-Pro CV) at 2 m depth; SBE37SMPODO (Sea-Bird) at 2 m depth; Meteo (meteorological station) at 4 m above sea level.
Sensor deployed from the research vessel during collection of discrete samples: Sea-Bird SBE19
Discrete samples for inorganic carbon (Total Alkalinity (TA) and pH) are collected from the station.

The dataset described here is collected during the ATL2MED demonstration experiment (see below) and consists of sensor data, 
discrete data, and metadata.

The sensor data was collected from 2020-07-16 to 2023-07-23
The discrete carbon data was collected at 2020-07-17.

The CO2 sensor measured every hour.

Discrete samples were collected and analysed for pH and Total Alkalinity (TA). Discrete pCO2 was calculated using CO2SYS 
(Pelletier et al., 2007), with the carbonate system constants from Lueker et al. (2000), the HSO4- constant from Dickson 
(1990), the total borate-salinity relationship of Lee et al. (2010), and the KF constant from Perez and Fraga (1987). 
pH was on total scale. The sensor pCO2 data (pCO2_corr) is corrected by adjusting these data to the calculated discrete pCO2.

The ATL2MED demonstration experiment took place in the North-East Atlantic between October 2019 and July 2020.
During this time, two Salidrone vessels equipped with scientific instruments sailed from the North-East Atlantic Ocean 
to the Gulf of Trieste in the Mediterranean Sea. A number of fixed stations also took part in the experiment, 
e.g., DYFAMED, W1M3A, E2M3A, PALOMA, and MIRAMARE, which all were visited by the Saildorne vessels.
